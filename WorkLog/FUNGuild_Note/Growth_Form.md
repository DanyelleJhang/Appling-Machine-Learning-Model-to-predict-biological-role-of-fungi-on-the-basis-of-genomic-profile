### 文獻內容

The database also includes information on growth morphology such as yeast, facultative yeast, or thallus (the latter being strictly defined here as a single or aggregation of cells that contributes to a single fungal individual such as some “chytrids” like Spizellomyces or members of the Laboulbeniomycetes (Alexopoulos et al., 1996)).

| Growth Form | Agaricoid         | Agaric         | An **agaric** ([/ˈæɡərɪk, əˈɡærɪk/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English)) is a type of [mushroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom)[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaric#cite_note-1) [fungus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus) [fruiting body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporocarp_(fungi)) characterized by the presence of a [pileus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pileus_(mycology)) (cap) that is clearly differentiated from the [stipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)) (stalk), with [lamellae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamellae_(mycology)) (gills) on the underside of the pileus. "Agaric" can also refer to a [basidiomycete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basidiomycete) species characterized by an agaric-type fruiting body. Archaically agaric meant 'tree-fungus' (after Latin *agaricum*); however, that changed with the Linnaean interpretation in 1753 when [Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus) used the generic name *[Agaricus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaricus)* for gilled mushrooms.<br />Most species of agarics are within orders of and describe the members of the order [Agaricales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaricales) in the subphylum [Agaricomycotina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaricomycotina). The exceptions, where agarics have evolved independently, feature largely in the orders [Russulales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russulales), [Boletales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boletales), [Hymenochaetales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenochaetales) and several other groups of the overarching phylum [Basidiomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basidiomycota). Old systems of classification place all agarics in the Agaricales and some (mostly older) sources use "agarics" as the colloquial collective noun for the Agaricales. Contemporary sources now tend to use the term **euagarics** to refer to all agaric members of the Agaricales. "Agaric" is also sometimes used as a common name for members of the genus *[Agaricus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaricus)*, as well as for members of other genera; for example, *[Amanita muscaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanita_muscaria)* is sometimes called "fly agaric". |
|             | Boletoid          | Boletus        | ***Boletus*** is a [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) of [mushroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom)-producing [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi), comprising [over 100 species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Boletus_species). The genus *Boletus* was originally broadly defined and described by [Carl Linnaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus) in 1753, essentially containing all fungi with hymenial pores instead of gills. Since then, other genera have been defined gradually, such as *[Tylopilus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tylopilus)* by [Petter Adolf Karsten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petter_Adolf_Karsten) in 1881, and old names such as *[Leccinum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leccinum)* have been resurrected or redefined. Some mushrooms listed in older books as members of the genus have now been placed in separate genera. These include such as *Boletus scaber*, now *[Leccinum scabrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leccinum_scabrum)*, *[Tylopilus felleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tylopilus_felleus)*, *[Chalciporus piperatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalciporus_piperatus)* and *[Suillus luteus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suillus_luteus)*. Most boletes have been found to be ectomycorrhizal fungi, which mean that they form a mutualistic relationship with the roots system of certain kinds of plants.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boletus#cite_note-3) More recently, *Boletus* has been found to be massively [polyphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphyletic), with only a small percentage of the over 300 species that have been assigned to *Boletus* actually belonging there and necessitating the description and resurrection of many more genera.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boletus#cite_note-Nuhn_2013-2)[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boletus#cite_note-Binder2006-4)[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boletus#cite_note-Dentingeretal2010-5)[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boletus#cite_note-Wu_2014-6) |
|             | Clathroid         | Clathrate      | A **clathrate** is a [chemical substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance) consisting of a [lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(group)) that traps or contains molecules. The word *clathrate* is derived from the [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language) *[clathratus](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/clathratus#Latin)* (*clatratus*), meaning ‘with bars, [latticed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure)’.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_compound#cite_note-1) Most clathrate compounds are [polymeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer) and completely envelop the guest molecule, but in modern usage clathrates also include [host–guest complexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host–guest_complex) and [inclusion compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_compound).[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_compound#cite_note-Ullmann-2) According to [IUPAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry), clathrates are inclusion compounds "in which the guest molecule is in a cage formed by the host molecule or by a lattice of host molecules."[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clathrate_compound#cite_note-3) The term refers to many molecular hosts, including [calixarenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calixarene) and [cyclodextrins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclodextrin) and even some inorganic polymers such as [zeolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeolite).<br />Many clathrates are derived from organic [hydrogen-bonded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-bond) frameworks. These frameworks are prepared from molecules that "self-associate" by multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions. |
|             | Clavarioid        | Clavaria       | ***Clavaria*** is a [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) of [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi) in the family [Clavariaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavariaceae). Species of *Clavaria* produce [basidiocarps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basidiocarp) (fruit bodies) that are either cylindrical to club-shaped or branched and coral-like. They are often grouped with similar-looking species from other genera, when they are collectively known as the [clavarioid fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavarioid_fungi). All *Clavaria* species are terrestrial and most (if not all) are believed to be [saprotrophic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saprotrophic) (decomposing dead plant material). In Europe, they are typical of old, mossy, unimproved grassland. In North America and elsewhere, they are more commonly found in woodlands. |
|             | Corticioid        | Corticium      | ***Corticium*** is a [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) of crust [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi) in the family [Corticiaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticiaceae). According to a 2008 estimate, the genus contains 25 widely distributed species.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticium_(fungus)#cite_note-Kirk2008-1) |

|             | Gasteroid         | Gasteromycetes | The **gasteroid fungi** are a group of [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi) in the [Basidiomycota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basidiomycota). Species were formerly placed in the obsolete [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(biology)) **Gasteromycetes** Fr. (literally "stomach fungi"), or the equally obsolete [order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)) Gasteromycetales [Rea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carleton_Rea), because they produce [spores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spores) inside their [basidiocarps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basidiocarps) (fruit bodies) rather than on an outer surface.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasteroid_fungi#cite_note-1) However, the class is [polyphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphyly), as such species—which include [puffballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffballs), [earthstars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthstars), [stinkhorns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinkhorns), and [false truffles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_truffles)—are not closely related to each other. Because they are often studied as a group, it has been convenient to retain the informal (non-[taxonomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology))) name of "gasteroid fungi". |
|             | Hydnoid           | Hydnum         | ***Hydnum*** is a [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus) of [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi) in the family [Hydnaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydnaceae). They are notable for their unusual [spore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore)-bearing structures of teeth rather than [gills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamella_(mycology)). The best known are the [edible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edible_mushroom) species *[Hydnum repandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydnum_repandum)* and *[H. rufescens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydnum_rufescens)*. The word is derived from *(h)udnon*/ύδνον, an [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek) word for truffle. The white or buff *Hydnum repandum* has a spore scatterer of still another shape. The smooth [cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pileus_(mycology)) grows as wide as 8 inches across. The [stem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_(mycology)) is off-center and is less than 2 inches long. *Hydnum* has many brittle, white teeth from which the spores drop. The mushrooms of the *Hydnum* group grow both on ground and on wood. Some species have teeth which hang from ascending branches, while other species have teeth which project downwards from the undersurfaces of dead wood. Most *Hydnum* are safe to eat. |
|             | Microfungus       |                | **Microfungi** or **micromycetes** are [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi)—[eukaryotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryotic) organisms such as [molds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mold_(fungus)), [mildews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildew) and [rusts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(fungus))—which have microscopic [spore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore)-producing structures.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfungi#cite_note-1) They exhibit tube tip-growth and have cell walls composed of [chitin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitin), a polymer of [*N*-acetylglucosamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Acetylglucosamine). Microfungi are a [paraphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyletic) group, distinguished from [macrofungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrofungi) only by the absence of a large, multicellular fruiting body. They are ubiquitous in all terrestrial and freshwater and marine environments, and grow in plants, soil, water, insects, [cattle rumens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumen), hair, and skin. Most of the fungal body consists of microscopic threads, called [hyphae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyphae), extending through the substrate in which it grows. The [mycelia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycelia) of microfungi produce [spores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore) that are carried by the air, spreading the fungus.<br />Many microfungi species are benign, existing as soil [saprotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saprotroph), for example, largely unobserved by humans. Many thousands of microfungal species occur in [lichens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen), forming [symbiotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis) relationships with [algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae). Other microfungi, such as those of the genera *[Penicillium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillium)*, *[Aspergillus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus)* and *[Neurospora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurospora)*, were first discovered as molds causing spoilage of fruit and bread.<br />Certain species have commercial value. *Penicillium* species are used in the manufacture of [blue cheeses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_cheese) and as the source of the [antibiotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic) [penicillin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penicillin), discovered by Sir [Alexander Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fleming) in 1928, while [*Fusarium venenatum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusarium_venenatum) is used to produce Quorn, a [mycoprotein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoprotein) food product. |
|             | Phalloid          | Phallus        | A **phallus** is a [penis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penis) (especially when [erect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection)),[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phallus#cite_note-1) an object that resembles a penis, or a [mimetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimesis) image of an erect penis. In art history a figure with an erect penis is described as **ithyphallic**.<br />Any object that symbolically—or, more precisely, iconically—resembles a penis may also be referred to as a phallus; however, such objects are more often referred to as being **phallic** (as in "**phallic symbol**"). Such symbols often represent fertility and cultural implications that are associated with the male sexual organ, as well as the [male orgasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_orgasm). |
|             | Polyporoid        | Polypore       | **Polypores** are a group of [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus) that form large fruiting bodies with pores or tubes on the underside (see [Delimitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypore#Delimitation_(morphology)) for exceptions). They are a morphological group of **[basidiomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basidiomycota)**-like [gilled mushrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaric) and [hydnoid fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydnoid_fungi), and not all polypores are closely related to each other. Polypores are also called **bracket fungi** or **shelf fungi**, and they characteristically produce woody, shelf- or bracket-shaped or occasionally circular [fruiting bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporocarp_(fungi)) that are called **conks**.<br />Most polypores inhabit tree trunks or branches consuming the wood, but some soil-inhabiting species form [mycorrhiza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza) with trees. Polypores and the related [corticioid fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corticioid_fungi) are the most important agents of wood decay, playing a very significant role in nutrient cycling and carbon dioxide production of forest ecosystems.<br />Over one thousand polypore species have been described to science,[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypore#cite_note-1) but a large part of the diversity is still unknown even in relatively well-studied temperate areas. Polypores are much more diverse in old natural forests with abundant [dead wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarse_woody_debris) than in younger managed forests or plantations. Consequently, a number of species have declined drastically and are under threat of extinction due to [logging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging) and [deforestation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation).<br />Polypores are used in traditional medicine, and they are actively studied for their medicinal value and various industrial applications. Several polypore species are serious pathogens of plantation trees and are major causes of timber spoilage.<br />Conks, the fruiting bodies of polypores, lie in a close planar grouping of separate or interconnected horizontal rows. Brackets can range from only a single row of a few caps, to dozens of rows of caps that can weigh several hundred pounds. They are mainly found on [trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree) (living and dead) and [coarse woody debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coarse_woody_debris), and may resemble [mushrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushroom). Some form annual fruiting bodies while others are perennial and grow larger year after year. Bracket fungi are typically tough and sturdy and produce their spores, called [basidiospores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basidiospore), within the pores that typically make up the undersurface. |
|             | Rust              |                | **Rusts** are plant diseases caused by [pathogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen) [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus) of the order **Pucciniales** (previously known as Uredinales).<br />An estimated 168 rust genera and approximately 7,000 species, more than half of which belong to the genus *[Puccinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puccinia)*, are currently accepted.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(fungus)#cite_note-auto-1) Rust fungi are highly specialized plant pathogens with several unique features. Taken as a group, rust fungi are diverse and affect many kinds of plants. However, each species has a very narrow range of hosts and cannot be transmitted to non-host plants. In addition, most rust fungi cannot be grown easily in pure culture.<br />A single species of rust fungi may be able to infect two different plant hosts in different stages of its life cycle, and may produce up to five [morphologically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)) and [cytologically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytologically) distinct spore-producing structures viz., [spermogonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermogonia), [aecia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aecia), [uredinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uredinium), [telia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telium), and [basidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basidia) in successive stages of reproduction.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(fungus)#cite_note-2) Each spore type is very host specific, and can typically infect only one kind of plant.<br />Rust fungi are obligate plant pathogens that only infect living plants. Infections begin when a spore lands on the plant surface, germinates, and invades its host. Infection is limited to plant parts such as leaves, petioles, tender shoots, stem, fruits, etc.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(fungus)#cite_note-auto-1) Plants with severe rust infection may appear stunted, [chlorotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorotic) (yellowed), or may display signs of infection such as rust fruiting bodies. Rust fungi grow [intracellularly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracellular), and make spore-producing fruiting bodies within or, more often, on the surfaces of affected plant parts.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(fungus)#cite_note-auto-1) Some rust species form perennial systemic infections that may cause plant deformities such as growth retardation, [witch's broom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch's_broom), stem canker, galls, or hypertrophy of affected plant parts.<br />Rusts get their name because they are most commonly observed as deposits of powdery rust-coloured or brown spores on plant surfaces. The Roman agricultural festival [Robigalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robigalia) (April 25) has ancient origins in combating wheat rust<br /> |
|             | Secotioid         | Secotium       | **Secotioid** fungi are an intermediate growth form between mushroom-like [hymenomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenomycete) and closed bag-shaped [gasteromycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasteroid_fungi), where an evolutionary process of **gasteromycetation** has started but not run to completion. Secotioid fungi may or may not have opening caps, but in any case they often lack the vertical [geotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotropism) orientation of the [hymenophore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenophore) needed to allow the spores to be dispersed by wind, and the [basidiospores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basidiospores) are not forcibly discharged or otherwise prevented from being dispersed (e.g. gills completely inclosed and never exposed as in the secotioid form of *[Lentinus tigrinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentinus_tigrinus)*)—note—some mycologists do not consider a species to be secotioid unless it has lost [ballistospory](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ballistospory&action=edit&redlink=1).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secotioid#cite_note-Hibbett_1994-1) |
|             | Smut              |                | The **smuts** are multicellular [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus) characterized by their large numbers of [teliospores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teliospores). The smuts get their name from a Germanic word for dirt because of their dark, thick-walled, and dust-like teliospores. They are mostly [Ustilaginomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ustilaginomycetes) (phylum [Basidiomycota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basidiomycota)) and can cause [plant disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_disease). The smuts are grouped with the other [basidiomycetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basidiomycetes) because of their commonalities concerning sexual reproduction.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smut_(fungus)#cite_note-1)<br />Smuts are cereal and crop [pathogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen) that most notably affect members of the [grass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass) family ([Poaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaceae)) and sedges ([Cyperaceae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyperaceae)). Economically important hosts include [maize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize), [barley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley), [wheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat), [oats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oats), [sugarcane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarcane), and [forage grasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forage_grasses). They eventually hijack the plants' reproductive systems, forming [galls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall) which darken and burst, releasing fungal [teliospores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teliospore) which infect other plants nearby. Before infection can occur, the smuts need to undergo a successful mating to form dikaryotic hyphae (two [haploid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haploid) cells fuse to form a [dikaryon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dikaryon)).[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smut_(fungus)#cite_note-2) |
|             | Thallus           |                | **Thallus** (plural: **thalli**), from [Latinized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek) θαλλός (*thallos*), meaning "a green [shoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot)" or "[twig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twig)", is the vegetative tissue of some [organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism) in diverse groups such as [algae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae), [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi), some [liverworts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchantiophyta), [lichens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen), and the [Myxogastria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myxogastria). Many of these organisms were previously known as the [thallophytes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallophyte), a [polyphyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphyly) group of distantly related organisms. An organism or structure resembling a thallus is called **thalloid**, **thallodal**, **thalliform**, **thalline**, or **thallose**.<br />The thallus of a [fungus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus) is usually called a [mycelium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycelium). The term thallus is also commonly used to refer to the [vegetative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetative_reproduction) body of a [lichen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen). In [seaweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaweed), thallus is sometimes also called '[frond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frond)'. |

The order contains both [teleomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleomorph) and [anamorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamorph) [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species), most of the latter being [yeasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeasts). All teleomorphic species in the Tremellales are [parasites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism) of other fungi, though the yeast states are widespread and not restricted to hosts. [Basidiocarps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basidiocarps) (fruit bodies), when produced, are gelatinous.<br />The order currently comprises 8 [families](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)), containing around 300 valid species. Significant [genera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genera) include *[Tremella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremella)*, two species of which are [edible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edible_mushroom) and commercially cultivated,[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremellales#cite_note-Hanelt2001-1) and the yeast genera *[Cryptococcus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptococcus_(fungus))* and *[Trichosporon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichosporon)*, several species of which are human [pathogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen).[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremellales#cite_note-Domer2004-2)[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremellales#cite_note-Wolf2001-3) |
