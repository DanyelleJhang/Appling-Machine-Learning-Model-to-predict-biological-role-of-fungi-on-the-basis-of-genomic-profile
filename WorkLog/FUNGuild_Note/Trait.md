### From Wiki

#### Hypogeous 

**Hypogeal**, **hypogean**, **hypogeic** and **hypogeous** (meaning "underground", from Greek hypó "under" + gaîa "earth"[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogeal#cite_note-1)) are [biological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological) terms describing an [organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism)'s activity below the [soil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil) surface.

In [botany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botany), a [seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed) is described as showing **[hypogeal germination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogeal_germination)** when the [cotyledons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotyledon) of the [germinating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germinate) seed remain [non-photosynthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis), inside the seed shell, and below ground.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogeal#cite_note-BellBryan2008-2) The converse, where the cotyledons expand, throw off the seed shell and become [photosynthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis) above the ground, is **[epigeal germination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigeal_germination)**.

The term **hypogeous** is used for fungi with underground fruiting bodies - for example, [truffles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truffle). The opposite term is [epigeous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigeous).



#### Blue-Staining(Contact Exploration Type) 

**Blue stain fungi** (also known as **sap stain fungi**) is a vague term including various [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi) that cause dark staining in sapwood.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_stain_fungi#cite_note-schmidt-1) The staining is most often blue, but could also be grey or black. Because the grouping is based solely on symptomatics, it is not a [monophyletic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophyletic) grouping.

The major economic damage caused by the blue stain fungi is aesthetic because of the usually undesirable discoloration of wood. Some of the fungi have also been shown to have detrimental effects on the strength properties of infected wood.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_stain_fungi#cite_note-zabel-6) Conversely, in some cases the staining is desirable in fine wood crafting applications where it is called [spalting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spalting).



#### Wood-decay fungus (White Rot, Soft Rot, Brown Rot)

A **wood-decay** or **xylophagous fungus** is any species of fungus that digests moist [wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood), causing it to [rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition). Some [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species) of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as *[Armillaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armillaria)* (honey fungus), are [parasitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic) and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the [fibre saturation point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre_saturation_point) in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-Harris_2001-1) Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called **lignicolous** fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-2) Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the [carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate) in wood and some others decay [lignin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignin). The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-Towards_modelling_of_decay_risk_of_wooden_materials-3)

Wood-decay fungi can be classified according to the type of decay that they cause. The best-known types are **brown rot**, **soft rot**, and **white rot**.[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-deacon-www-4)[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-minnesota-5) Each produce different enzymes, can degrade different plant materials, and can colonise different environmental niches.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-Decay_of_cultivated_apricot_wood-6) The residual products of decomposition from fungal action have variable pH, solubility and redox potentials. Over time this residue will become incorporated in the soil and sediment, so can have a noticeable effect on the environment of that area.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-Decay_of_cultivated_apricot_wood-6)

- ***Brown Rot***

  Brown-rot fungi break down [hemicellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemicellulose) and [cellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose) that form the wood structure. Cellulose is broken down by [hydrogen peroxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide) (H2O2) that is produced during the breakdown of hemicellulose.[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-deacon-www-4) Because hydrogen peroxide is a small [molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule), it can diffuse rapidly through the wood, leading to a decay that is not confined to the direct surroundings of the fungal [hyphae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha). As a result of this type of decay, the wood shrinks, shows a brown discoloration, and cracks into roughly cubical pieces, a phenomenon termed cubical fracture. The [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi) of certain types remove [cellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose) compounds from wood and hence the wood becomes a brown [colour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour).

  Brown rot in a dry, crumbly condition is sometimes incorrectly referred to as *dry rot* in general. The term *brown rot* replaced the general use of the term *dry rot*, as wood must be damp to decay, although it may become dry later. [Dry rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_rot) is a generic name for certain species of brown-rot fungi.

  Brown-rot fungi of particular economic importance include *[Serpula lacrymans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpula_lacrymans)* (true dry rot), *[Fibroporia vaillantii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroporia_vaillantii)* (mine fungus), and *[Coniophora puteana](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coniophora_puteana&action=edit&redlink=1)* (cellar fungus), which may attack [timber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber) in buildings. Other brown-rot fungi include the [sulfur shelf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laetiporus_sulphureus), *[Phaeolus schweinitzii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaeolus_schweinitzii)*, and *[Fomitopsis pinicola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomitopsis_pinicola)*.[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-stamets-7)

  Brown-rot fungal decay is characterised by extensive demethylation of lignins whereas white-rot tends to produce low yields of molecules with demethylated functional groups.[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-the_effect_of_fungal_decay_on_wheat_straw_lignin-8)

  There are very few brown rot fungi in [tropical climates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_climate) or in southern [temperate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_climate) zones. Most brown rot fungi have a [geographical range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)) north of the [Tropic of Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer) (23.5° latitude), and most of these are found north of the 35° latitude, corresponding to a roughly [boreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarctic_climate) distribution. Those brown rot fungi between latitudes 23.5° and 35° are typically found at high elevations in pine forest regions, or in [coniferous forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_coniferous_forest) regions such as the [Rocky Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains) or the [Himalayas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas).[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-SymposiumIsaac1993-9)

- ***Soft rot***

  Soft-rot fungi secrete [cellulase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulase) from their [hyphae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha), an [enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme) that breaks down [cellulose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose) in the wood.[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-deacon-www-4) This leads to the formation of microscopic cavities inside the wood, and sometimes to a discoloration and cracking pattern similar to brown rot.[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-deacon-www-4)[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-minnesota-5) Soft-rot fungi need [fixed nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen#Biological_role) in order to synthesize enzymes, which they obtain either from the wood or from the environment. Examples of soft-rot-causing fungi are *[Chaetomium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaetomium)*, *[Ceratocystis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceratocystis)*, and *[Kretzschmaria deusta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kretzschmaria_deusta)*.

  Soft-rot fungi are able to colonise conditions that are too hot, cold or wet for brown or white-rot to inhabit. They can also decompose woods with high levels of compounds that are resistant to biological attack. Bark in woody plants contains a high concentration of [tannin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannin), which is difficult for fungi to decompose, and [suberin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suberin) which may act as a microbial barrier.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-bark_decay-10) The bark acts as form of protection for the more vulnerable interior of the plant.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-bark_decay-10) Soft-rot fungi do not tend to be able to decompose matter as effectively as white-rot fungi: they are less aggressive decomposers.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-Decay_of_cultivated_apricot_wood-6)

- ***White rot***

  White-rot fungi break down the [lignin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignin) in wood, leaving the lighter-colored cellulose behind; some of them break down both lignin and cellulose.[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-minnesota-5) As a result, the wood changes texture, becoming moist, soft, spongy, or stringy; its colour becomes white or yellow.[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-11) Because white-rot fungi are able to produce enzymes, such as [laccase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laccase), needed to break down lignin and other complex [organic molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_molecule), they have been investigated for use in [mycoremediation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycoremediation) applications.[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-cohen02-12)

  There are many different enzymes that are involved in the decay of wood by white-rot fungi, some of which directly oxidize lignin.[[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-biodegradation_of_oak_wood-13) The relative abundance of [phenylpropane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylpropane) alkyl [side chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_chain) of lignin characteristically decreases when decayed by white-rot fungi.[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-the_effect_of_fungal_decay_on_wheat_straw_lignin-8) It has been reported that the oyster mushroom (*Pleurotus ostreatus*) preferentially decays lignin instead of polysaccharides.[[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-degradation_of_lignin_in_wheat_straw_during_growth_of_the_oyster_mushroom-14) This is different from some other white-rot fungi, e.g., *[Phanerochaete chrysosporium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerochaete_chrysosporium)*, which shows no selectivity to lignocellulose.[[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-degradation_of_lignin_in_wheat_straw_during_growth_of_the_oyster_mushroom-14)

  [Honey mushroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_mushroom) (*Armillaria spp.*) is a white-rot fungus notorious for attacking living trees. *[Pleurotus ostreatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurotus_ostreatus)* and other [oyster mushrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster_mushroom) are commonly cultivated white-rot fungi,[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-cohen02-12) but *P. ostreatus* is not [parasitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic) and will not grow on a living tree, unless it is already dying from other causes.[[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-Stamets2000-15) Other white-rot fungi include the [turkey tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trametes_versicolor), [artist's conk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganoderma_applanatum), and [tinder fungus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomes_fomentarius).[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-stamets-7)

  White-rot fungi are grown all over the world as a source of food – for example the [shiitake mushroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiitake_mushroom), which in 2003 comprised approximately 25% of total mushroom production.[[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood-decay_fungus#cite_note-monitoring_decay_of_black_gum-16)
